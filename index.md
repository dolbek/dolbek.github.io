## About Me

My name is Jesse Dean, and I live in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I am currently in my third year of pursuing a Bachelor's of Computing Science degree.
I hope to start my CS career as a software engineer in Vancouver, and see where things take me. I am potentially interested in working in application security,
embedded systems, machine learning, or software development in any medium to low level language.

### About This GitHub

For now, I intend to use this GitHub account to store any personal projects or school projects of note, with the intent of contributing to some interesting open
source projects as time allows.

This site is still under construction, and past projects have not yet been linked to.
