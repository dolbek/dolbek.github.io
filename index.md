## About Me

My name is Jesse Dean, and I live in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I am currently in my third year of pursuing a Bachelor's of Computing Science degree.
I hope to start my CS career as a software engineer in Vancouver, and see where things take me. I am potentially interested in working in application security,
embedded systems, machine learning, or software development in something like C or C++.

### About This GitHub Account

For now, I intend to use this GitHub account to store any personal projects or school projects of note, with the intent of contributing to some interesting open
source projects as time allows.

### Introduction to Projects

A good example of a school project I have worked on is https://github.com/dolbek/android-calculator, a calculator application written in Java using Android Studio.

The same logic was repurposed as a Qt project in C++ here: https://github.com/dolbek/Windows-Calculator-App. It is worth noting that the C++ project does not address the inherent floating point inaccuracy. This project was intended as an exercise in C++ and more importantly, an introduction to the Qt framework, and time constraints did not allow for me to take this further than a proof of concept.

Finally (for now), is the Tic Tac Toe mobile game for android: https://github.com/dolbek/TicTacToeAndroid. The purpose was to explore Android Studio, and to develop a robust decision-tree AI to play against, which can be toggled between random moves, and optimal moves. The latter is unbeatable.

I hope to add to this account with further projects I develop, but my studies this term are currently focused more on Software Architecture and some lower level OS concepts, and so don't lend themselves to shareable GitHub projects very well.
